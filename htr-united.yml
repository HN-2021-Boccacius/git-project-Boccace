transcription-guidelines: 'No development of abbreviations. Special characters are
  used for the graphemic transcription, compatible with the Unicode mufi qnd the special
  character table of cremma-medieval.   No correction of orthography errors, BUT proper
  transcription of inversed letters (for Inc59) such as character "n" printed as "u"
  in several cases.  Spaces were added freely for word separation according to dictionaries
  of middle French and Latin (latin forms verified on Collatinus).  For more documentation
  regarding the transcription norms and guidelines head to the repository and the
  report file.''''
