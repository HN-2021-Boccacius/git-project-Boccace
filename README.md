# git-project-Boccace
This repository hosts all the documents, including transcriptions, bibliographical references and introduction that serve the team Boccace for the validation of the course "Bonnes pratiques du developpement collaboratif : initiation à Git" (prof. Thibault Clérice), of the first semester - Master Humanités Numériques ENC-PSL 2021-2022. 

TO BE COMPLETED YET :
Enumeration, descritpion (with links to notices) and choice of the manuscripts/incunabula that we are transcribing.
 
Principles of standardisation of the transcriptions. 

We chose a graphemic transcription method, following D. Stutzmann definitions (see bibliography), to have a sign in the image corresponding to a sign in our text: all the abbreviations are kept, and u/v or i/j are not distinguished. The spaces in the dataset are not homogeneously represented, sometimes transcriptions reproduce the manuscript spacing while others use lexical spaces.

+++++++

How do we ensure our quality of data (continuous integration workflow via Github Actions)

We can add bibliography here instead of a separate odt file.
